I wrote this book while preparing for a System Administration job. It serves as a structured summary of my previous work, developed through studying Google's course on '[System Administration and IT Infrastructure Services](https://www.coursera.org/learn/system-administration-it-infrastructure-services)' and it also functions as a quick-reference guide.

I'm trying to understand what success looks like and how we can achieve it, so that we can repeat those patterns over and over again.
