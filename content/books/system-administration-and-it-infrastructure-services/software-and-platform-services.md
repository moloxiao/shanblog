Software services are the services that employs use that allow them to do their daily job functions. This can include applications like Word processors, Internet browsers, email clients, chat clients, and so on.  

# Software Service

User Productivity Services: Agreements and Licenses  :  
* This section highlights the key differences between using software as a consumer and using it in a business setting.  


Web Server Security Protocols : 

* HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, ensuring secure communication between web browsers and websites through encryption.
* TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a widely used protocol for securing communication over a network, including web browsing.
* To enable HTTPS and TLS on a web server, a digital certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) is required
* TLS is the successor to SSL. TLS is more secure than SSL.

Everyone should be thinking about security and all layers of your infrastructure should have a layer of security built upon them.  

# File Services
File storage services allow us to centrally store files and manage access between files in groups. There are lots of providers that offer secure and easily managed file storage.  

Network File Storage :  
* Network file system, or NFS, allows us to do this. It's protocol that enables files to be shared over a network. 
* Samba(you might want to consider Samba over NFS is because it works better with Windows operating systems. SMB is a protocol that Samba implements)
* A relatively affordable solution for file storage hardware is to use a network attached storage or NAS, pronounced NAS.

Mobile Synchronization :  

# Print Services  

Troubleshooting Printer Issues : 
* Printer manual : If you are unfamiliar with a printer or don’t know how to troubleshoot a specific issue, always consult the printer manual or the printer manufacturer’s website.
* Paper jam : Always check the manufacturer’s jam removal procedure, and do not pull on the jammed paper, as this can damage the printer. If the printer reports a jam when there is no paper inside, one of the jam sensors needs repair.  
* Incorrect paper size : Check the Page Setup interface in applications like Microsoft Word to see if the paper size is set up properly. If this is set up properly and the problem persists, then uninstall and reinstall the printer driver.
* Paper not feeding : Check for overflowing paper trays and correct paper position. If the problem persists, try cleaning or replacing the printer’s pickup rollers with a cleaning solution like denatured alcohol.  
* Faded print : First, remove the printhead from the printer, then clean it using cleaning solutions, such as denatured alcohol. Next, dry off the cleaned printhead, then place it back in the printer. Finally, print a test page to check the print quality.  
* Toner doesn’t fuse to printer : Check the printer settings to ensure that the paper type and size is the same as the paper that is in the tray. If the issue persists, remove the fuser unit and check for damage. Replace the fuser if needed.  
* Lines down printed page : Clean the printhead with denatured alcohol. If the problem persists, replace the printhead.  
* Garbled print : First, reboot the printer. If the issue continues, check the printer driver. Then, uninstall and reinstall the printer driver.  
* Multiple prints pending in the queue : Clear the print queue. Then, reinstall the printer driver.

Common printer types :  
* Fuser assembly : Two rollers melt toner and permanently affix image/text on to paper
* Transfer belt : Moves paper through printer and passes it across the imaging drum
* Pickup rollers : Picks up paper from the tray and feeds it into the printer
* Imaging drum : Transfers the image on to the page
* Separation pads : Spins under paper, pushes sheets back, prevents multiple pages from feeding into printer

* Printhead : Delivers ink onto the paper
* roller : Moves the page down to the next line without any gaps
* Ink cartridge : Stores the ink for the printhead  
* Duplexing assembly : Turns paper over and reroutes it through printer for double-sided printing
* Feeder : Feeds the paper in to the printer

* Heating element : Burns dots into the surface of heat-sensitive thermal paper
* Feed assembly : Automatically draws the paper past the heating element

* Print head : The case that holds the print wires
* Ribbon : A modular case that contains one very long ribbon
* Tractor feed : Feeds the paper in to the printer

* Print bed : The surface the filament or resin model is printed on
* Resin : Liquid photopolymer that’s layered into a solid object  
* Filament : Plastic that melts when heated

# Platform Services
If you're an IT Support specialist with a web service that needs to be managed, you should have a pretty good understanding of how it works

Malware is malicious software that can modify, steal, or delete data. It poses a significant threat to BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) practices because it can compromise the security of personal and corporate data on devices brought into the organization.
