## 4-Level Framework of the Science-of-Learning Principles
| Level | Core Question | Key Principle(s) | How it links to the adjacent levels |
|-------|---------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **4. Desired Outcome** | What do we ultimately want for every learner? | Well-organised, durable knowledge in long-term memory (Principles 3 & 4) | This outcome is attainable only when the three lower levels are in place; it serves as the “north-star” for curriculum design and teaching practice. |
| **3. Enabling Environment** | What classroom climate makes that outcome possible? | Belonging & feeling valued (Principle 1) | A strong sense of belonging lowers anxiety, boosts engagement, and creates the psychological safety required for deep practice and consolidation. |
| **2. Personal Drivers** | What individual factors power sustained engagement? | Social-emotional wellbeing (Principle 4) and Motivation (Principle 5) | Positive emotions and intrinsic motivation free cognitive capacity, allowing students to persist with the deliberate practice needed to stabilise knowledge in memory. |
| **1. Fundamental Learning Law** | How does the mind actually build new knowledge? | All new ideas are interpreted through existing knowledge (Principle 2) | Prior knowledge is the substrate on which every other level acts; teachers must surface, connect, and extend it, or the higher-level supports cannot translate into durable learning. |

Practical Implications for Teachers :  
| Planning Stage               | Guiding Questions drawn from the framework |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Before a unit**            | • What do students already know and believe about this topic? (L1)<br>• How will I tap into their cultural identities to foster belonging? (L3) |
| **During teaching**          | • Are tasks scaffolded to minimise cognitive overload and build competence? (L2)<br>• Do routines promote collaboration and mutual respect? (L3) |
| **Practice & consolidation** | • Am I providing spaced and varied practice that re-links to prior knowledge? (L1 → L4) |
| **Monitoring wellbeing**     | • How are students’ emotions fluctuating today?<br>• What autonomy-supportive choices can I offer? (L2) |
| **Assessing outcomes**       | • Can learners retrieve and apply knowledge flexibly in new contexts? (L4) |



## Learning area structure(UDK:Understand, know, do)
There are five phases of learning, spanning years 0–13. Each phase covers two to three years of schooling, which reflects how most schools organise learning across year levels.

* Phase 1 (years 0–3): Thriving in environments rich in literacy and maths 
* Phase 2 (years 4–6): Expanding horizons of knowledge, and collaboration 
* Phase 3 (years 7–8): Seeing ourselves in the wider world and advocating with and for others 
* Phase 4 (years 9–10): Having a purpose and being empathetic and resilient 
* Phase 5 (years 11–13): Navigating pathways and developing agency to help shape the future.


each school board with students in years 0–8 must, through its principal and staff, structure their teaching and learning programmes and/or timetables to provide:
* **10 hours per week** of teaching and learning focused on supporting students’ progress and achievement in reading and writing, and recognising the important contribution oral language development makes, particularly in the early phases of learning 
* **5 hours per week** of teaching and learning focused on supporting students’ progress and achievement in maths.
