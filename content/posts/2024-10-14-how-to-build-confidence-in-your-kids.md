Sometimes I feel that I'm too strict with my children, and I'm worried that this might affect their confidence. I've started reflecting on this.  

# Principle
* **validate your kids' experiences and feelings** : even if you don't agree with them. This means letting them know that you hear them and understand how they're feeling
* **set boundaries and teach your kids how to cope with difficult situations** : This means helping them to understand that their feelings are valid, but they don't always dictate their decisions

# Methord : The way to build confidence in your kids
Remember that building confidence takes time. Be patient and supportive, and your kids will eventually learn to believe in themselves.  
* **give them opportunities to try new things and overcome challenges** : This helps them to learn that they are capable of doing difficult things
* **to be a role model for your kids** : Show them how to handle difficult situations with grace and confidence
  
I hope to reflect every week.

Just had a conversation with my kiddo about cleaning up after themselves. I started with,   
"Why do you think it is important to clean up messes?"   
After some time to think and hints, they got it.   
I asked why it is important they clean up their messes.   
They melted down as they don't want to do that.   
But after a cool down time, they came back with some good answers.   
I think asking Why also helps with buy-in and give them the message that their thinking and reasons matters.   
They aren't being arbitrarily asked to do things. It takes more time,   
but I think that showing this respect helps them build self respect.

Notice the preferred use of the word “and” versus “but.” Good advice.
