What is missing in ML? **Reasoning** . HUman can learn from just a few examples because human can reason.  

```
"Bill Gates" -> ls
"Shan Xiao" -> sx
```

Solve it by ML? Tons of labeled data need. finally, you can get an accuracy like 85%, 90% or something.  
Would you still refer to ML as AI when it requires vast amounts of labeled data to learn such a "simple" task?
