## Notes

### 1 
Imagine you want to get really good at reading — so good that you can understand any book easily in 6 months.

To reach that goal, you make a plan:
Like reading a little every day, learning new words, and practicing reading out loud.

But sometimes, things don’t go as planned:
1. After 3 days, you feel bored or tired and stop. That’s because we didn’t make a plan to help you feel happy or excited to keep going.
2. Maybe you try to just remember all the words without understanding the story. That’s not the best way, and no one is checking to help you do better.
3. Or maybe your goal is too big or unclear, so you don’t know what “I’m good at reading” really means.  

So, the smart way to reach your goal is not just making a to-do list.
You also need a system — something that helps you stay happy, learn the right way, and know how close you are to finishing.
