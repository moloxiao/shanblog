I think the author made a very good attempt and deserves praise. However, I found many parts difficult to understand—perhaps because some necessary steps were simplified. In my opinion, it would still be quite challenging for an average high school student to fully grasp the content.   
Since AI can assist with reading, I think providing an outline might be more appropriate than giving detailed explanations myself.  

## 1 A simple neural network


## 2 How are these models trained? - **gradient descent**


## 3 How does all this generate language?

## 4 What makes LLMs work so well?

### 4.1 Embeddings

### 4.2 Sub-word tokenizers


### 4.3 Self-attention
First,  
> So far we have seen only one simple neural network structure, one which contains a number of layers and each layer is fully connected to the next.  
> However, as you can imagine **there is nothing stopping us from removing or making other connections**.

problem example :  
>"Damian had a secret child, a girl, and he had written in his will that all his belongings, along with the magical orb, will belong to ____". This word here could be "her" or "him" and it depends specifically on a much earlier word in the sentence: girl/boy.  
  

Then,  
>If the important word was always in the same position, it would learn the weights appropriately and we would be fine. However, the relevant word to the next prediction could be anywhere in the system.
> So, we need weights that depend not only on the position but also on the content in that position. 
  
How do we achieve this? - **Self-attention**.   
> If we write the weights as u1, u2, u3 such that output = u1x1+u2x2+u3x3 then how do we find these weights u1, u2, u3?  
> self attention uses the word immediately preceding the word we are about to predict.  
  
so we want weights for these vectors.

### 4.4 Softmax 
Transform a real-valued vector into a probability distribution to represent the relative likelihood of each class.  


### 4.5  Residual connections  
out put F(x)+x better than F(x).
> Title: Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition  
> Authors: Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun  
> Conference: CVPR 2016  
> ArXiv: [arXiv:1512.03385](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)

We simulate a simple residual structure:  
> Output = F(x) + x  

where F(x) consists of two linear layers with ReLU activation in between. 

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Define a simple residual block
class SimpleResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim):
        super(SimpleResidualBlock, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, input_dim)  # First linear transformation
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()                       # ReLU activation
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(input_dim, input_dim)  # Second linear transformation

    def forward(self, x):
        residual = x              # Save the input for the skip connection
        out = self.fc1(x)         # Apply first linear layer
        out = self.relu(out)      # Apply non-linearity
        out = self.fc2(out)       # Apply second linear layer
        out += residual           # Add the input (residual connection)
        return F.relu(out)        # Final activation (optional)

# Create a dummy input tensor
x = torch.randn(4, 10)  # Batch size = 4, feature dimension = 10

# Initialize the residual block
block = SimpleResidualBlock(input_dim=10)

# Forward pass
output = block(x)

print("Input x shape:", x.shape)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)

```

* Input and output shapes are identical, since the residual connection adds the original input 𝑥 back to the output of the transformation F(x).
* The line out += residual is the core of the residual connection.
* The final ReLU is optional, but helps introduce non-linearity.

### 4.6 Layer Normalization

> Title: Layer Normalization  
> Authors: Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, Geoffrey E. Hinton  
> Conference: CVPR 2016  
> ArXiv: [arXiv:1607.06450](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450)

this is about normalization, Why Normalization Helps ?  
We tested two cases:
* Using raw (unnormalized) input, like [1000,2000,3000]
* Using normalized input, with zero mean and unit variance  

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Case 1: Unnormalized input
x = torch.tensor([[1000.0], [2000.0], [3000.0]])
y = 2 * x + 1

model = nn.Linear(1, 1)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.000001)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

# Training loop
for epoch in range(1000):
    pred = model(x)
    loss = loss_fn(pred, y)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print("Unnormalized input:")
print("Loss:", loss.item())
print("Learned weight and bias:", model.weight.item(), model.bias.item())

```
and   

```python
# Case 2: Normalized input
x_raw = torch.tensor([[1000.0], [2000.0], [3000.0]])
x_mean = x_raw.mean()
x_std = x_raw.std()
x_norm = (x_raw - x_mean) / x_std
y = 2 * x_raw + 1  # target stays the same

model = nn.Linear(1, 1)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)  # faster learning rate
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

# Training loop
for epoch in range(1000):
    pred = model(x_norm)
    loss = loss_fn(pred, y)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print("Normalized input:")
print("Loss:", loss.item())
print("Learned weight and bias:", model.weight.item(), model.bias.item())

```

### 4.7 Dropout
> Dropout is a simple but effective method to avoid model overfitting.  
  
just dropout. 

### 4.8  Multi-head attention
Imagine you are reading the sentence:
**"The cat sat on the mat."**  

* Helper 1 looks at where the words are in the sentence (the order).
* Helper 2 tries to find out who is doing what — like "cat" is doing "sat".
* Helper 3 thinks about how words are related in meaning — like "cat" and "mat" both go together.  

Each helper pays attention in a different way.  


### 4.9 Positional embeddings
Positional Embeddings give the model a sense of word order, so it knows not just what words are present, but also where they are.  
help neural network understand the sequence.
