> "All education is about learning to think. It's about learning to problem solve. And whether that was 30 years ago, now or 30 years from now. I think the technology changes over time, but if you can learn how to solve problems, you are going to do great things."

The world is changing faster than ever before, thanks to the rapid development of AI and other new technologies. In this environment, the most important thing we can learn is not any specific tool or language, but the ability to solve problems.

## Why Problem Solving Matters More Than Ever

No matter the era, those who succeed are the ones who can figure out solutions to new and unexpected problems. Information and skills are valuable, but the true core is adaptability—the ability to analyze a challenge, break it down, and find a workable path forward.

## What Sequence Should We Follow?

When learning or building anything new, especially in a rapidly-evolving field like AI, there’s a classic sequence that can guide our approach:

1. Make It Work
2. Make It Right
3. Make It Fast


## The Most Important Step: Start and Sustain

Knowing the right sequence is useless if you never take the first step. The most important thing is to **start**—even if you don’t feel ready. Equally important is to **keep going**. Progress comes from consistent, small actions over time.

So we are building a tool called [Thought Manager](https://thought-manager.vercel.app). My child and I use it to record our daily plans. Through this process, we hope to:
* Develop our own framework for solving problems
* Make good use of helpful tools—especially AI
* Learn how to accomplish things and encourage each other along the way  


**Become resilient and adaptable individuals, ready to thrive in the future world**.
