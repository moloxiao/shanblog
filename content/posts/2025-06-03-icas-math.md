Logical Relationships Between Algebra & Patterns Knowledge Points :  
1. **Entry level** : Start by recognizing number and visual patterns ([1], [2]), to build foundational "pattern thinking."  
2. **Rule Generalization** : Transition from observing to deducing the rule ([3]), learning to describe it using words or expressions.  
3. **Function Modeling** : Use tables or functions to represent input-output relationships ([6], [7]), which leads to using variables.  
4. **Algebraic Expression and Solving** : Introduce variables and letters ([4]), then gradually move to solving equations ([5]), and substitution ([8]).
