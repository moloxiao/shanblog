I believe the same question applies to myself: how can I become a survivor in the world of the future?  

## 1. Core Value: Create Value

- No matter the time or job, creating value is always important.
- The best jobs are those that help people and make a difference.

## 2. Key Principles: How to Grow That Value

- **Technology drives progress** : New tools and machines change the world.
- **Use money to make more money** : that’s the power of capital
- **Use people to create more value** : that’s the power of organization

## 3. Success Tips: Three Simple Rules

1. Right time, right place, right people.
2. Be brave, careful, and confident.
3. Know people, work with people, lead people.

## 4. Learn from History

### 4.1 Lessons from Japan's "Lost 20 Years"

1. Japan’s “lost 20 years” saw the **rise** of affordable businesses like 7-Eleven, Uniqlo, MUJI, Daiso, and Saizeriya.
2. Meanwhile, traditional giants like home appliances and cars declined.
3. Japan missed the wave of computers, the internet, and mobile phones.

### 4.2 Career Choices of Top Chinese Graduates

Top Chinese graduates didn’t all enter high-tech fields:
  - Wang Xing from Tsinghua went into food delivery.
  - Huang Zheng (ZJU), Liu Qiangdong (RUC) went into retail.
  - Zuo Hui and Cheng Wei from BUCT went into real estate and ride-hailing.
These are some of the smartest people in China — and they chose these industries.


## 5. Future Trends

- Some people will earn from **high-tech**.
- Others will earn from **hands-on work** done very well (like nursing, fixing things, cutting hair).
- Being skilled and following clear steps (SOPs) will be key.

## 6. Final Thoughts

Personally, I think the people who will create the most value in China in the future will fall into two extremes:

1. One group will be in high-tech fields.
2. The other group will be in hands-on, professional service jobs.

Whether it’s skilled **nursing**, **haircutting**, or technical work like **electricians**, **plumbers**, or **mechanics** — I believe these roles will be valuable and in high demand.

For ordinary people, combining professional skills with standardized SOPs is a powerful way to create value. And if you can add a touch of high-tech, you’ll be at the forefront of the wave.
