I read a twitter from [Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1325154823856033793):   

> How to become expert at thing:   
> 1. iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth wise, learning “on demand” (ie don’t learn bottom up breadth wise)
> 2. teach/summarize everything you learn in your own words
> 3. only compare yourself to younger you, never to others  

So I write this for think about this topic. 

## 1 Understand the basic rules

* Depth
* Feynman Technique : If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.  


## 2 from Beginner's zone to Reality
AK avoided a hard truth of the real world:  
**Value is defined by relative position, not absolute effort.**  

Once we leave the beginner's zone and enter a world of limited resources and real competition, comparing only to our past selves becomes a slow path to strategic self-destruction.  

The path to true mastery isn’t just about grinding.
It requires regularly switching between two modes:
1. Monk – focused practice, deep execution, internal growth, building strength.
2. Seeker – going out, studying the best, analyzing strategies, recalibrating direction.

Use the monk’s focus to solve execution problems.
Use the seeker’s insight to solve strategy problems.
