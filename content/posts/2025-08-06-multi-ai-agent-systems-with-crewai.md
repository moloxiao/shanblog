It's very interesting mental shift from regular engineering.

AI agent workflows will be a key driver of AI progress in the near term.
Multi agent workflows let you break down the complex tasks into subtasks that can be executed by agents, each of which plays a particular defined role.

example : 
* if you goal is get a research report written, the roles might be resarcher, writer, and fact checker. 
* if you want to get a website built, perhaps the roles could be a web designer, software engineer and testing engineer.

why create crewAI : needed a tool to build better agents to help him write Linkedin posts.
