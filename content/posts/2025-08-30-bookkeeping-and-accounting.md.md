## 1.1 concept

The two basic accounting methods are **cash-based accountging** and **accrual accounting** :  
* **Cash-basis** accounting records revenue when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid.
* **Accrual accounting** records revenue when it’s earned and expenses when they’re incurred—whether or not cash has moved yet.

Accounting equation:
> Assets = Capital(Equity) + Liabilities
