Hello, my friends. Last week, I published a new product: [Resume Manager](https://resumemanager.pages.dev). I have two reasons for creating this product:  
1. to manage my resume and application process,   
2. to create a platform for new AI  

Currently, it is still a demo version, but if you want to try it, you can get started now.  

## STEP BY STEP

1. visit [Resume Manager](https://resumemanager.pages.dev), click 'Get Started ->'

4. change theme

5. Click 'Next' to sequentially edit Personal Detail, Summary, Professional Experience, Education, and Skills.  

Now, you have a complete resume that can be downloaded as a PDF (currently achieved by printing to PDF) and shared via a link.

## Conclusion
It's still in a demo state, and I am sharing it with my friends to make it easy for them to try. Over the next few weeks, I will add new features and improve the interactions every week, incorporating some great ideas from my friends. Let's work together to see if we can make it even better.
