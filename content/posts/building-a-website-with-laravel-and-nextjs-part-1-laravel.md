# Recommended API Response Format
```
{
  "success": true|false,
  "data": {}, 
  "message": "Human readable message",
  "errors": {}
}
```
Advantages of This Format :  
1. Clear success/failure indicator: The success field explicitly indicates whether the request was successful
2. Separation of data and messages: data contains the actual response data, while message provides a user-friendly description
3. Structured error information: The errors field can contain field-level validation errors when needed
4. Consistency: All API endpoints use the same format, simplifying frontend handling
5. Self-documenting: The response structure is intuitive and communicates its purpose clearly
6. Flexibility: Works well for both simple and complex responses across different types of operations
7. Frontend compatibility: Makes it easier to implement consistent UI feedback based on standardized response structure
