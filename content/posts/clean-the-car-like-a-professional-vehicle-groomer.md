The video covers the steps of washing, rinsing, and refoaming the vehicle.

Use pH neutral soap and water.
Foam the vehicle first to let the soap grab the dirt.

Rinse the vehicle off with water.
Rinsing:

Use a pressure washer to rinse the vehicle.
Start at the top of the vehicle and work your way down.
Make sure to rinse all the dirt off of the vehicle.
Check for any spots that you missed.
Refoaming:

Refoam the vehicle again.
Go in for the contact wash.
