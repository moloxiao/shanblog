Just like you see, this blog you are visiting is created using Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages. In the process of using Hugo, I researched a lot to answer my questions. Here are some common issues.

## How to Create Pages and Posts with Hugo Commands
To create a new post in Hugo, you can use the following command:  
```
hugo new posts/your-post-title.md
```
For example, if you want to create a new post titled "my-first-post," you would run:  
```
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```
This command will create a file named my-first-post.md in the content/posts directory. The file will include predefined front matter, such as the title, date, and other metadata.

Ensure that your Hugo project structure contains the content/posts directory. If it doesn't, you can manually create the directory or adjust the command path according to your project's structure.

If you want to create a new page instead of a post, you can modify the command path. For example, to create a new page:  
```
hugo new about.md
```
This will create a file named about.md in the content directory.


## add google analytics

1. Update config.toml  
Open your config.toml file. Add the Google Analytics parameter:
```
[params]
  google_analytics = "G-XXXXXXXX"
```
2. Locate and Edit baseof.html  
Navigate to "themes/your-theme-name/layouts/_default/". 
Open baseof.html for editing :  
```
...

<head>
    {{- partial "head.html" . }}
    
    {{- partial "head.html" . }}
    {{ if .Site.Params.google_analytics }}
    <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id={{ .Site.Params.google_analytics }}"></script>
    <script>
      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
      gtag('js', new Date());
      gtag('config', '{{ .Site.Params.google_analytics }}');
    </script>
    {{ end }}
</head>
...
```

## Configure Hugo to Generate a Sitemap
Hugo has built-in support for generating XML sitemaps. You just need to enable it in your configuration file.
Open your Hugo projectâ€™s configuration file config.toml(or config.yaml). Add or update the following configuration to enable the sitemap :  
```
[outputs]
  home = ["HTML", "RSS", "SITEMAP"]

[sitemap]
  changefreq = "weekly"
  priority = 0.5
  filename = "sitemap.xml"
```
vist check :
```
http://127.0.0.1:1313/sitemap.xml
```
