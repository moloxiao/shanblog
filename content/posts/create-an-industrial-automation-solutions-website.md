I want to consolidate my experience and knowledge in the field of automation, and I’ve decided to do this by creating a website. I also hope it can serve as a starting point for offering consulting services.  
Since this website is content-focused, I chose to build it using **Docusaurus** and deployed it on Cloudflare. I spent an hour setting up the template and configuring automated deployment. You can now access it by [clicking here](https://automation.micostupid.com).

Now, Let's Consider 3 questions in sequence:

2. the pages needed to achieve that purpose
3. the main content of each page
