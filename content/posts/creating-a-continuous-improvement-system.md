When we want to accomplish something or achieve a goal, sometimes we succeed, and sometimes we face challenges. Can we find a method that makes it easier to succeed? My answer is PDCA(plan–do–check–adjust).    
Just do it, let it fail if necessary, and then find a new way to fix it.    


# What is a system  
```
The goal of all science, is to substitute visible complexity for invisible simplicity.  
- John Baptiste Perrin
```  

a system contains 5 part :  
1. **GOAL** : What impact or income by when ?  
2. **WORK** : what products or service are needed to achieve the goal and which are most profitable .  
3. **RESOURCES** : what resources are needed to achieve the goal and how much of each is needed ?  
4. **RULE** : what decision rules to win for design, planning, execution and continuous improvement .  
5. **METRICS** : what lag and lead performance and rule compliance metrics are needed to remain focused ?
