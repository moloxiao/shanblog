In the current [Resume Manager](https://resumemanager.pages.dev/) application, the module I use the most on a daily basis is the job application module, with its core feature being the tracking of resume submissions. Moving forward, I want to enhance the ability to match resumes with job requirements. This will involve the following steps: 
1. Analysis of the recruitment process and the needs of each stage  
2. Resume Match evaluation 
4. Process adjustment

# 2 Resume Match evaluation  
the three most important aspects of a resume are :  
1. Core Skills
2. Work Experience
3. Achievements & Project Experience  

## 2.1 Core Skills
**Why it’s important** :  
* Core skills demonstrate whether the candidate possesses the technical or professional expertise required for the role. 
* **This is one of the first things recruiters look for to assess** if the candidate’s abilities match the job requirements.  
  
**What to showcase** :  
* Include skills that are directly relevant to the job, such as programming languages, tools, or management skills. 
* Ensure these core skills align with the key competencies mentioned in the job description.  

## 2.2 Achievements & Project Experience  
**Why it’s important** :  
* Achievements and project experience highlight the candidate’s ability to create value in previous roles.  
* This section shows not only what the candidate can do, but also how they have positively impacted the business.   
  
**What to showcase** :  
* Emphasize key contributions in important projects, particularly those that are relevant to the role.  
* Use numbers or specific examples to illustrate outcomes, such as increased efficiency, revenue growth, or leading critical projects.



## 2.3 Work Experience
**Why it’s important** :   
* Work experience shows how the candidate has **performed** in previous roles. 
* It gives recruiters insight into whether the candidate has the practical experience needed to succeed in the new role.  
  
**What to showcase** :   
* List relevant past work experiences, focusing on **responsibilities** and **achievements** that relate directly to the job. 
* Clearly describe projects, contributions, and measurable results where possible.


# 3 Process adjustment   
After changing the resume to fit the job, follow these steps to check it :
