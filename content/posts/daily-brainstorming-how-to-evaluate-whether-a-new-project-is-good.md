I am a software engineer, and sometimes I feel like a man with a hammer seeing everything as a nail. I've been in this field for a long time and have often noticed that doing more doesn't always lead to better results. The question is: how can I evaluate whether a new project is good?  

 there are two axes to consider when selecting an project: 
 * **feasibility** 
 * **value**  
 Feasibility is how easy it is to do the project, and value is how much value the project will deliver to the business.  

 # A framework for quantifying the value of an project  
 it's about : 
 * **efficiency**(saving time and effort, reducing risk) - easy
 * **new revenue** - hard

 efficiency always focus on people, which includes considering :  
 * the number of people involved
 * the percentage of their time that they spend on the project
 * the cost per person  

# Summary
When evaluating whether a new project is good, we focus on feasibility and value.
