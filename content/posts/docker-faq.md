## Scene 1 
**Scenario Analysis**  
You are using a minimal Vultr server instance (1 CPU, 1GB RAM, 25GB SSD) for personal development and testing.  
The server runs multiple environments such as Python, PHP, and Java. The workload is light but involves frequent testing, diverse language stacks, and limited system resources.

**Recommended Strategy**  
1. Deploy each project using Docker, with a dedicated `docker-compose.yml` file per project if needed.  
2. Share service containers like MySQL across projects to avoid redundancy and conserve resources.  
3. Configure swap space to handle memory limitationsâ€”this is especially important with only 1GB of RAM.

**Advanced Suggestions**  
- Use **Portainer** for a graphical interface to manage your Docker containers and services more easily.  
- Implement **Traefik** or **Nginx Proxy Manager** to handle domain routing, SSL certificates, and reverse proxy rules across multiple projects.  
- Mount container volumes to the host system to ensure persistence of important test data and configuration.

This setup offers an efficient, clean, and scalable development environment that is ideal for personal or small-scale multi-language testing on low-resource hardware.
