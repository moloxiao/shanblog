## 1.1 Events
Currently, we only support 'sundayservice', but we plan to support :  
* Each event will have its own accessible page; 
* a list will display all events; 
* different event types will have distinct styles

You can jump to the next service pages by clicking the '[Next Service](https://cornerstonecongregational.org/next)' button on the homepage :
