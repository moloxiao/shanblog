## Regions
|Region|	Economic Contribution (%)|	Economic Value (NZD)|	Estimated Employment|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|Marlborough|	~40%|	~156 million|	~320 jobs|
|Hauraki Gulf|	~18%|	~70 million|	350 jobs|
|Nelson|	~15%|	~58.5 million|	~120 jobs|
|Thames-Coromandel|	~18%|	~70 million|	350 jobs|
|North Island Overall|	~9%|	~35.5 million|	~80 jobs|  

1. The estimated per capita economic value for the mussel farming industry in New Zealand in 2023 is approximately NZD **325,000** per job.  
2. This high value reflects the **capital-intensive** nature of aquaculture, where significant investments in technology, infrastructure, and equipment are required, and the value generated per worker can be substantial.  

## technological
Hereâ€™s a table summarizing the expected investment in key technological areas of New Zealand's mussel farming industry over the next 5 years, along with the potential impact on the existing industry:  
|Technological Area|	Estimated Investment (Next 5 Years, NZD)|	Potential Impact on Industry|
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Selective Breeding and Genetic Improvement| 	10 - 20 million	| Improved mussel quality and yield; limited direct impact on employment.| 
| Automation and Precision Aquaculture| 	50 - 100 million| 	Increased efficiency and reduced labor in routine tasks; potential job loss in manual roles but creation of tech-related positions.| 
| Sustainability and Environmental Monitoring| 	20 - 30 million	| Enhanced sustainability; may increase operational costs, potentially impacting job numbers.| 
| Expansion of Farming Areas| 	30 - 50 million	| Creation of jobs in construction and site management; potential job balancing with automation integration.|
