When I first tried to sign up for [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/new/u/0/pub-8639536784870126), I got turned down. Here are the reasons why(the reasons Google gave for turning me down) : 
```
We do not allow Google-served ads on screens:

without content or with low value content,
that are under construction,
that are used for alerts, navigation or other behavioural purposes.
```
  
So **Getting a blog accepted by Google AdSense** means you need to **creating high quality sites**.  
So, I made a list of what they needed, and I worked on each thing one by one until I met all the requirements.
