# 2 Speaking

English is a "stress-timed" language, which means : 
1. we stress certain sounds in a sentence and 
2. we leave an equal amount of time between all of these stresses.  
This creates a **rhythm**. examples :  
* The **boy** and the **girl** **run** to **school**.  
* **Zoos** are **places** where **animals** **live** in **cages**  
* The **hills** and the **mountains** were **covered** in **flowers**

|Test Item|Full Name|Skills Assessed|Number of Tasks|Time per Task|Total Time|
|:-:|:--:|:----|:----|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|RA|Read Aloud |Pronunciation, fluency, and intonation|7|40/s|5/m|
|RS|Repeat Sentence |Listening, memory, pronunciation, and fluency|12|20/s|4/m|
|DI|Describe Image |Speaking fluency, clarity, and ability to interpret visual information |7|60/s|5/m|
|RL|Re-tell Lecture |Listening comprehension, summarization, pronunciation, and fluency.|4|50/s|5/m|
|ASQ|Answer Short Question |Listening and quick recall |12|20/s|2/m|

Tasks explain :   
* RA : You’ll see a text passage on the screen (typically 40-60 words) and are asked to read it aloud  
* RS : You’ll hear a short sentence and then repeat it exactly as you heard it
* DI : You’ll see an image (e.g., a graph, chart, map, or diagram) and describe it in detail within a time limit 
* RL : You’ll listen to a lecture and then re-tell it in your own words within a time limit 
* ASQ : You’ll hear a simple question and need to provide a brief answer, usually just one word or a short phrase

Tips :  
* RA :  Focus on speaking clearly, at a natural pace, and with correct emphasis on keywords
* RS :  Pay close attention to the structure and key words. Practice repeating sentences to improve memory and accuracy 
* DI :  Practice describing images clearly and concisely. Focus on main points, trends, or details shown in the image 
* RL :  Take notes on key points, main ideas, and any specific terms. Try to structure your retelling logically 
* ASQ :  Answer clearly and concisely. Familiarize yourself with common question types to improve response speed

## 2.1 RS(Repeat Sentence)

* Round1 :  There are 154 questions, with 30 questions each day.

## A-1 Mock Test Review

### A-1-1 Speaking mock test - 13 Nov 2024
![First Mock](/images/2024-11/screen-01.png)  
This was my first test, and I spent 15 minutes on it. I only practiced RS for 2.5 hours over three days. I just wanted to see my current level.    
AI Tips :  
* You need to improve your familiarity with the templates for DI and RL, and make sure the "key terms" in the templates are clear.
* Your performance on the RS, RL, and ASQ questions in speaking isn’t very strong. RS should be your top priority in future practice.
