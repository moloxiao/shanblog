# Example

## Senior Computer Vision & Machine Learning Engineer
**Company** : [BEDC Limited](https://www.us.bedc.ai/)  
```
“We’d like you to execute development work on our market-leading, patented AI solution,   
which takes 2D PDF architecture documents and is able to recognize, count, measure, and specify everything needed to price and build a construction project.   
Our AI solutions help our customers (manufacturers and retailers of materials for building projects) automate the processes of quantity surveying."   
- Ben Powles CEO.  

“We'd love for you to apply if you like hands-on coding, working within small but efficient teams, and a flat structure.   
This is an applied role so expect little research. Using machine learning techniques,   
you must be strong at building models; and tackling tasks such as complex image segmentation, object recognition, feature extraction, and so forth.  
We're seeking someone experienced. Perhaps you're already a lead level AI developer.”  
 - Jonathon Reid, Chairman.  
```

Requirements :  
* 5+ years of development experience in AI, image, or computer vision related use cases.
* 3+ years of experience in a senior or lead role.
* Fluent in Python and production code.
* Experience using unique machine learning techniques in real business use cases, such as YOLO models, deep learning, transformers, auto-encoders, etc.
* Deep understanding of the methodology and pros/cons of various approaches.
* You take pride in improving the results of your models based on real business use, and assess your work beyond your accuracy metrics and test data sets.
* You've reported to an AI lead where you've discussed approach, timelines, task breakdowns, success criteria, backlogs, and feature requirements  
  

## Test Technician  
**Company** : [Buckley Systems Ltd](https://www.buckleysystems.com/)
