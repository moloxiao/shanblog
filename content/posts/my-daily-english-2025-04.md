# Tea time

* Do you like being in the sun? or Do you like soaking up the sun?
* Are we having a 30-minute or 1-hour break at lunchtime today?  

# What's app

- I have been unwell this week
- Sorry to hear that. Hope you’re feeling better now.


# Bike

* I pulled a muscle in my left calf while running, and it never fully recovered.
* "I even had a cramp during my last ride.
* I hope proper stretching will help me.
