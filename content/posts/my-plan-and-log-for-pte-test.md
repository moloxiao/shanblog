## Notes:
- **Speaking & Writing section** has the **highest combined weight (~50%)**.
- **Repeat Sentence** and **Write from Dictation** are the **most valuable tasks** across the whole exam due to their dual-score contribution.
- Reading and Listening sections, while shorter in time, contain tasks that impact **multiple scoring areas**.
- Good **time management** and use of **templates/shortcuts** can help maximize scores in limited prep time.
