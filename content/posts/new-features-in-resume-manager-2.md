Hello, all my friends. Thank you for all your ideas and feedback, help this product better.  
We're back! The last update was **18 days ago**. This week I use **6 hours** to add new feature : **Job Application Task Manager**. [Click here to experience it now](https://resumemanager.pages.dev/).

Here are some of the main interfaces :  

1. **New Dashboard**

Because we added the job application manager, the dashboard has changed.  

2. **Job Application List**

We can add new job applications and change the application status on this page.  

3. **Edit apply**

## Next steps

* Display the daily changes in job applications and feedback through a line chart.
* Supports pre-application status management, such as recording a job position before applying.
* Supports new parameters, such as City.
