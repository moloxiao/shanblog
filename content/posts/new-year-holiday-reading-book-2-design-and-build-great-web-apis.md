Recommendation Rating: ★★★☆☆  
This book has two key features:  
1. Every topic starts with the basic fundamentals(not just from software require, from basic thinking); 
2. It provides a comprehensive framework of web API   

It attempts to establish a system, but it lacks rigor and is quite verbose. When it comes to specific operations, it lacks detail. It can only be considered a collection of organized notes with some highlights, but it falls short of being truly good.  


# Securing APIs
API security consits of three key elements :  
* identity
* access control
* encryption
