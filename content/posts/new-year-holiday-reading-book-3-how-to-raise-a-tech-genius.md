Recommendation Rating: ★★☆☆☆  
The best way to teach someone to learn something is by helping them experience it and solve real-world problems. However, compared to a standard curriculum, this approach requires much more skilled teachers, is harder to standardize, and therefore tends to be more expensive.   
For me, the good thing is that there’s a purpose in teaching kids information technology, which helps me rethink everything I do to better support my kids in using it.  

# Book Highlights
**Purpose of study** :  
* A high-quality computing education equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world.
* The core of computing is computer science, in which pupils are taught the principles of information and computation, how digital systems work and how to put this knowledge to use through programming.  
* They are able to use and express themselves and develop their ideas through information and communication technology
* At a level suitable for the future workplace and as active participants in a digital world  
  
**AIMS** :  
* understand the concepts and priciples of computer science and its components(abstraction, logic, alogorithms and data representation)  
* be able to analyse problems using computational thinking and to have practical experience of programming solutions to problems
* be able to evaluate their use of technology and apply their knowledge to solve problems
* to use technology safely and responsibly
