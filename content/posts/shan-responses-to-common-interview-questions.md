# 1 General Interview Questions

## 1.1 Tell me about yourself  
I will share four parts of my experience related to this job: 1. my work on IoT projects; 2. my experience with SQL and databases; 3. my background in web development; and 4. my knowledge of the energy sector.
1. I created an IoT light product using Socket, ESP8266, and React, and published it to EC2. Additionally, we developed a manufacturing test system that supports GE and Osram IoT projects. This included working with AWS IoT Core, Broadcom chips, and MQTT.
2.  SQL and Database: Currently, I am working on a contract to optimize a system, focusing on improving SQL queries. Initially, there were 450 slow queries, and now there are 400. I have optimized some of the critical queries. Additionally, I have written a full-version ERP system, which involves managing complex relationships within the database.
3. Web Development: Currently, my tech stack includes Flask (or Django) for the backend API. For the frontend, I use Next.js and ShadUI for the user interface.

## 1.2 Why are you interested in this role/company?
I am looking for challenging tasks, like managing charging stations. I think there are still many challenges, such as compatibility issues between different manufacturers and IoT security problems. I hope we can find a way to let machines talk to each other.

## 1.3 What are your strengths and weaknesses?


## 1.4 What are your career goals?
I hope that in the next five years, I can find ways to make machines talk to each other on their own. But my small goal for this year is to have AI generate more than 50% of the code I use every day.

## 1.5 How do you handle pressure and deadlines?


## 1.6 Describe a challenging project you worked on and how you overcame obstacles.
I can't find a single book that influenced my life because many books have had an impact on me.  
There is an issue with a query that takes over 60 seconds to execute, involving the bulk entry of only a few hundred parts into the inventory. One of the tables requires querying over a million records, which can cause the application to run out of memory and lead to data inconsistency. I use batch processing to prevent memory overflow, but the question remains: why query a million records? Is it possible to avoid this query?

An additional example related to distributed systems: for instance, a database setup includes 1 master node and 2 slove nodes. Some operations need to complete additional tasks immediately after writing data. If a query is made to the slove nodes right away, the data might not have synchronized yet

## 1.7 about visa
My wife is currently studying for a graduate degree, and I have a dependent work visa, which is unrestricted. My wife will graduate in July.
