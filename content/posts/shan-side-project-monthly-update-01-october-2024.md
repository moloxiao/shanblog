Starting this month, I will share my side project plan each month.  
For the last two weeks, I’ve been busy with moving. Next week, the kids will be back to school, so I’ll have more time to work on my side project.  

# 1 Nathaniel Pomodoro
This [project](https://nathaniel-pomodoro.vercel.app/) was created to help my brother Nathaniel manage his youth support project.  
**This week (12th October 2024), I supported Māori**.

This month, I hope to dedicate 1 or 2 hours each week to focus on this side project. If we can discuss how to use it without software support  (such as how teachers assign tasks and how students complete and provide feedback) this month, we might be able to determine the key features for the next steps.  

# 2 The tools help create children's stories with pictures, text, and audio 
I plan to finish the first version. It's for my kids to create wonderful stories and easily share them with their friends.  

# 3 Update Resume Manager
Currently, this [project](https://resumemanager.pages.dev/) is focused on job applications. I will try to find a way to help people overcome the issue of online applications where no one reads the resume. My approach is to support the manager in visiting hiring companies and participating in face-to-face meetings.
