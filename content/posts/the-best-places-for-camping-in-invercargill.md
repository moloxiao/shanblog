**Hunt for Treasure at Gemstone Beach**. It’s about a 45 minute walk one way to reach Gemstone Beach by foot, or a 5 minute drive by car. This beach is full of hidden gems, literally! People have found everything from jasper, garnet, quartz, sapphire to fossilized worm casts and more. You might just get lucky and strike gold!
