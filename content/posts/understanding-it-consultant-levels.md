This grading system isn't just about technical skills. An experienced software engineer might be able to reach L4 level in just a week, and a top computer science graduate could do the same. If our goal is to help more people achieve their objectives, this will require a diverse set of skills.  

Here are the different dimensions at each level :  
| **Level** | **Technical Skills** | **Project Management & Leadership** | **Problem Solving & Decision Making** | **Communication & Client Interaction** | **Strategic Planning & Architecture** |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|

| **L3**    | 50%                  | 30%                                | 30%                                   | 20%                                   | 10%                                 |
