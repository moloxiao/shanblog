My philosophy is **Learn just enough to solve your current problem and expand your understanding naturally as new challenges arise**. I have a wide interest in technology, so my biggest challenge is staying focused.  So, **focus means choosing a field and specializing in it**.

# Principle
* Understand which level is best for the current problems(Like TCP/IP, HTTP, or user-defined protocols.)  
* The sequence to solve this problem(like sometimes the question is about the user interface, and other times the problem is about creating a more efficient algorithm)  

# Technology Stack
